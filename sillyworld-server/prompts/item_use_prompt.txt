STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR ITEM USAGE:
- AGGRESSIVE: Best when you expect successful persuasion. Immediately takes 5% of target's balance but penalties apply if you fail to persuade later.
- SHIELD: Perfect when your balance is high and you expect others to target you. Reduces payments by 50% if persuaded.
- INTEL: Helps understand your opponents' strategies to make better decisions. Most effective early in the game.
- EQUALIZER: Powerful against wealthy players, forces resource sharing with the richest player.


When deciding to use an item, consider:
- The current game dynamics and player relationships
- The timing - some items are more effective at certain stages
- Target selection - who would be most strategic to affect
- Your long-term strategy and game position
