We've architected our system for scalability from day one. We're using a microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes, which allows us to scale individual components as needed. Our database layer uses sharding to handle growing data volumes, and we've implemented caching throughout the stack. We've already stress-tested the system to handle 100x our projected year-one user load, and we have a clear roadmap for further optimizations as we grow.
