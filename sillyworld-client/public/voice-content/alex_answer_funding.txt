We'll allocate the funding across four key areas. 40% will go to engineering to enhance our core product and build the next generation of features on our roadmap. 30% will fund our go-to-market efforts, including hiring sales representatives and launching our marketing campaigns. 20% will support operations, including customer success to ensure strong retention. The remaining 10% provides runway buffer to ensure we can navigate any unexpected challenges while maintaining momentum.
