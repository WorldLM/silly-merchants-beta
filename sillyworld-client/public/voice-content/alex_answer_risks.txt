We've identified three primary risks. First, regulatory changes could impact how we handle data, which we're mitigating by building privacy-first architecture and staying ahead of compliance requirements. Second, larger competitors could enter our niche, so we're focused on moving quickly to establish strong network effects. Third, we face execution risk in scaling our team, which is why we've brought on advisors who've successfully scaled similar businesses and implemented structured onboarding processes.
