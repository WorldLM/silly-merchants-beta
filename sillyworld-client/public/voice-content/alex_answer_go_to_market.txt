Our go-to-market strategy has four pillars. We're starting with direct sales to enterprise customers in the financial and healthcare sectors, where we have strong connections. Simultaneously, we're building a self-service platform for SMBs. We've also established partnerships with three industry-specific consultancies who will resell our solution. Finally, we're creating thought leadership content to drive inbound interest. This multi-channel approach allows us to capture different segments of the market efficiently.
