Thank you for your pitch. I'm impressed by the clarity of your vision and the depth of your understanding of the customer problem. Your unit economics look promising, though I'd want to see more validation of the customer acquisition costs. The team's background is strong, which is crucial for execution. I have some concerns about the timeline to profitability, but overall, I see this as an attractive opportunity with substantial upside potential.
