Great question about unit economics. Our current CAC is projected at $950 per customer, which we expect to decrease by about 30% as we optimize our funnel. On the LTV side, our revenue model projects an average customer lifetime of 24 months with an average monthly value of $350. This gives us an LTV of approximately $8,400, and an LTV:CAC ratio of 8.8:1, which is well above the industry benchmark of 3:1.
