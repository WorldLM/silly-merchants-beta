We've implemented a tiered subscription model with three levels based on usage volume and feature access. Our starter tier begins at $299 per month, our professional tier at $999, and enterprise at $2,499. We've validated these price points with potential customers, finding strong willingness to pay given the ROI we deliver. Additionally, we offer implementation services and premium support as add-ons, which we expect to contribute about 15% of revenue while improving retention.
